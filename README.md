## Overview
> <sub>*Some useless text explaining the non-issue this is trying to solve*</sub>


Playing games<sup>1</sup> alone can be boring, but there's no reason to play alone! Chances are high that there is someone that plays that game too
and you just need to find them. DBuddyBot tries to help by letting members of a Discord server subscribe to a game, and getting pinged when someone wants to play.
It's just that easy, who would've thought!  
<sub><sup>1</sup> That have a multiplayer mode<sub/>

### Features
> <sub>*Actually something useful, explaining what this thing can do!*</sub>

DBuddyBot only includes the most cutting edge features, like:
+ Adding<sup>1</sup> new Discord roles based on game names
+ Subscribing and unsubscribing to those games/roles
+ Getting information on subscriber count of these roles<sup>2</sup>  
<sub><sup>1</sup> Admin rights are needed, no spam adding new games for normal users, sorry</sub>  
<sub><sup>2</sup> Probably even more information at some point</sub>

### Future Features
> <sub>*Sometimes I actually plan stuff!*</sub>

Everybody loves a roadmap, so here are some things that are planned to be implemented soon<sup>TM</sup>!
- [ ] Use of an actual **database**! Impressive, I know
- [ ] More **information** on games! The future is now and the internet can magically print game infos apparently
- [ ] Better **stability** and **performance**. Enough with those error messages everyone ignores anyways
- [ ] **More**.. just stuff. More stuff! Feel free to suggest features you'd like to see
- [x] ~~Better **configuration**! Write some stuff in a file and you're good to go~~
- [x] ~~**Logging**! Not cutting down any forests though, just logging some info on bot abuse~~

### License
> <sub>*You got a license for that, Sir?*</sub>

I'm not a lawyer but licenses are good I think.
So this thing is licensed under the [**MIT LICENSE**](https://github.com/pron1x/DBuddyBot/blob/master/LICENSE). Very original.

<sub>Yea all in all this `README` isn't really that good to be honest but whatever, I was bored.</sub>
